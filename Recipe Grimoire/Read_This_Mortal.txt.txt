🌙 Whispered Secret:
If your herbs ever turn bitter or lifeless — don’t toss them.

Old hedge witches would “wake the leaves” by briefly placing 
dried herbs in a cast iron pan and letting them kiss the 
flame for three heartbeats. The aroma would bloom, and their 
magic would return, sharp and alive. It’s said this ritual 
stirs not just flavor, but memory.

Try it once... see what awakens.
